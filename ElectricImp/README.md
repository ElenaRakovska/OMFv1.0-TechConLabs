# DragonBoard Code

## About

This repo contains code for the 2017 OSIsoft TechCon OMF-themed labs.  For more information on the labs, and to register to attend the labs, see https://www.osisoft.com/users-conference/emea/day3.html.  The lab synopsis is listed below:

In this instructor-led, hands-on lab you will learn about the updated PI Connector framework architecture, the new OSIsoft Message Format (OMF), and how OMF can address your IoT data ingress needs. We will teach you the basics of the PI System architecture and the primary data structures it contains as required to understand OMF: PI tags, assets, and Event Frames. You will be provided with an IoT edge device and sample code and will use these to develop your own OMF based application to ingress data to the PI System. This lab is recommended for individuals who are curious about IoT, edge devices, and how these can be applied to the PI System, and don't mind learning new or sharpening existing software development skills. This lab requires basic PI System knowledge and basic programming skills. A general understanding of current developer technologies like Python, Node.js, and Java is a plus, but not required. For more information, watch this video! https://youtu.be/Ni5bqHCFWGA

This lab comprises OMF integrations using two different IoT devices, the Electric Imp and the Qualcomm DragonBoard; the files listed here specifically apply to the Electric Imp only.

## Contributing

Please do feel free to offer up comments and suggestions; however, the code for this lab is fixed, so as to offer the students a consistent experience and code style across multiple different OSIsoft classes.  For additional OMF-themed content, we recommend taking a look at https://github.com/osisoft/OMF-Samples.
